# Week 3 Task

In lecture, I introduced you to the concept of fuzzy logic

For the remainder of the lesson you can do one of two things

1. Using an example implementation, found [here](https://github.com/darrened/526/tree/main/Week3/fuzzy_library.py), 
as reference - using SKFuzzy, create your own fuzzy logic system.  
Consider:
   1. If time is short or complexity is hard then additional study hours is high. 
   2. If complexity is medium then additional study hours is medium. 
   3. If time is long and complexity are easy then additional study hours is low.


2. If you click [here](https://github.com/darrened/526/tree/main/Week3/fuzzy_vanilla.py), you will find a partial 
implementation of fuzzy logic using vanilla Python. You simply need to complete this and then try to get it to work with
the example system in task 1
