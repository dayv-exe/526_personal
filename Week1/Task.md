# Week 1 Task

In lecture, you got an understanding of how the A* algorithm works.

Now it is time for you to implement it!

Don't worry, I understand that you are fresh off the summer break, so I have provided you with some code and comments 
to help  
[click here](https://github.com/darrened/526/tree/main/Week1) to go to the directory.

It contains the following files:
* __mazes/maze1.txt__ - A demo map, s=start, g=goal, x=obstacle. Obviously you can also create your own
* __utils.py__ - Includes some useful functions including a map importer and will calculate the manhattan distance for you
* __pathfinding.py__ -  where you will write the code for the A* algorithm, guided by the comments
* __tui.py__ - Where you will create a simple tui interface to show the path taken

Ideally, I would like you to pair up and engage in 'pair programming' in order to complete this task.

Be sure to share the completed code with your partner
