# Week 2 Task

In lecture, we spoke about the concept of Expert Systems.
I then showed you a demo of a mini-expert system, similar to one you will now implement yourself!

I'm also going to take this opportunity to make a point about AI tools and code development.

If you were to ask AI to generate a forward chaining expert system, it will give you something like this: 
[click here](https://github.com/darrened/526/tree/main/Week2/forward_chaining.py).

If you run that code, you will find it is far from perfect, in fact it needs quite a bit of work!
It is definitely not in a state in which you could submit for any kind of grading if you are hoping to do well.

However, as with any AI tool, it is a nice aid and sometimes a good starting point, which is how we are going to use it today!

Using the code provided above, modify it so that it:
1. Works correctly
2. Asks questions that enable it to narrow down the answer

You should also improve its feedback mechanism so that it is more informative

Remember, this is AI generated code, not an expectation - you can make as big a change to it as you see necessary!  
The point you will soon see is that AI is helpful, but do not trust it to do it all for you (at least, not yet!)

As with last week, you can pair up and engage in 'pair programming' in order to complete this task.
Don't forget to share the completed code with your partner!

If you complete this task, then consider creating a new file and using what you have just done to implement a backward chaining expert system
