# Week 7 Task

Today we are going to look at the very basics of training a classifier using scikit learn. We will build upon this 
further in upcoming weeks

First, we need to make sure we have a couple of libraries installed:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```
scikit learn gives us implementations of various ML algorithms, including the ones explained in lecture

In addition, we will also be working with data - so the pandas library is extremely helpful for this

```bash
pip install pandas
```
Ok! Let's go! 

## Tasks

1. Much of the lecture was spent going over the different algorithms. I have provided an example of 2 of 
these [here](https://github.com/darrened/526/tree/main/Week7/classification.py).
This example is using the famous [Iris dataset](https://github.com/darrened/526/tree/main/Week7/iris.csv) (1936) 
published: [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)
   * Attempt to get the above working on your machine. 
   * Run it and note the accuracy scores.
   * Run it again, note the scores again - anything interesting? Can you explain this?

   
2. Look up one of the other algorithms from the lecture. Implement that one yourself using the scikit learn 
documentation. Print out the accuracy for that one too.
